  o Major bugfixes (circuit building):
    - Conflux circuit building was ignoring the "predicted ports" feature,
      which aims to make Tor stop building circuits if there have been
      no user requests lately. This bug led to every idle Tor on the
      network building and discarding circuits every 30 seconds, which
      added overall load to the network, used bandwidth and battery from
      clients that weren't actively using their Tor, and kept sockets open
      on guards which added connection padding essentially forever. Fixes
      bug 40981; bugfix on 0.4.8.1-alpha;
